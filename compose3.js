const sentence = `In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigmâ€”a style 
of building the structure and elements of computer programsâ€”that treats 
computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids 
changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm in 
that programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of 
statements. Functional code is idempotent: a function's return value depends 
only on its arguments, so calling a function with the same value for an 
argument always produces the same result. This is in contrast to imperative 
programming where, in addition to a function's arguments, global program state 
can affect a function's resulting value. Eliminating side effects, that is, 
changes in state that do not depend on the function inputs, can make 
understanding a program easier, which is one of the key motivations for the 
development of functional programming.`;
